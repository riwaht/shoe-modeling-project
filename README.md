# shoe-modeling-project
This React project was created in order to model a 3d shoe with its different components.

The shoe was made in Blender, by Yuri Artiukh.

I was able to do this through libraries such as Three.js, GLTFJSX, all under https://github.com/pmndrs.

The user can interact with the color picker to color each part of the shoe, through assigning different states to each.
